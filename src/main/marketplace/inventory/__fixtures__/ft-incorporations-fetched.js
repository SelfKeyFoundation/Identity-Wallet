				introduction:
					'<p>The Abu Dhabi Global Market Free Zone (ADGM) is a no-tax international financial services center located in Al Maryah Island in the heart of the UAE&rsquo;s capital city, Abu Dhabi. The Free Zone is administered and governed by three independent authorities: the Registration Authority, the Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) and the ADGM Courts.</p>\n<p>Companies incorporated in the ADGM enjoy a full corporate tax exemption until 2063, no foreign ownership restrictions, no limits on repatriation of profits, no withholding taxes, and access to a wide range of tax treaties.</p>\n<p>ADGM companies can conduct business and trade within the Free Zones and internationally, but cannot do business with UAE residents out of Free Zone areas, without a UAE resident agent.</p>\n<p>ADGM company regulations are based on the UK Companies Act of 2006. The ADGM has an English speaking common law environment and has its own courts and dispute resolution bodies. The Shariah Law does not apply within the free zone.</p>\n<p>A company must have at all times a physical office that must be located in Al Maryah Island, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. However, physical office requirements vary according to business activity. For instance, SPVs and Fintech Companies may fulfill this requirement with a Virtual Office lease.</p>\n<p>A company carrying out a commercial activity must be approved by the ADGM Registration authority and obtain a commercial license.</p>\n<p>The non-financial and retail business activities permitted include professional service providers, such as law firms and accounting firms, consultants, business training providers, IT and HR/search firms, corporate headquarters, management offices and treasury functions, single family offices and proprietary investment entities, holding companies and special purpose vehicles, industry and professional associations, retail outlets, F&amp;B and services, among others.</p>\n<p>A commercial license will also be issued upon incorporation of the company. This document allows the company to conduct business in ADGM in accordance with the approved activities stated in the Commercial License. The license is valid for one year and renewable upon filing the relevant form, paying the relevant fee to the Registrar and completing other applicable requirements for Commercial License renewal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Companies conducting financial services activities are regulated by the Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) and must obtain the appropriate license to operate. These include international and Islamic banks, lending and credit institutions, fund management companies, investment businesses, hedge funds, banking, hedge funds, forex and securities dealers, cryptocurrency exchanges, among others.</p>\n<p>Regulated companies must appoint an authorized individual resident in the UAE as senior executive officer, chief financial officer, compliance officer, and money laundering reporting officer &ndash; authorized individuals must be UAE residents.</p>\n<p>There is an attractive SPV regime in ADGM. SPVs are private companies established to hold and protect assets, with the purpose of segregating&nbsp;financial and legal risk by ring-fencing assets and liabilities. SPVs can be established as subsidiaries, project or joint venture vehicles.</p>\n<p>Protected Cell Companies (PCC) and Incorporated Cell Companies (ICC) are available. A Protected Cell Company (PCC) is a corporate structure in which a single legal entity is comprised of a core and several cells that have separate assets and liabilities. An Incorporated Cell Company (ICC) is similar to Protected Cell Company but adopts a fundamentally different approach to cells. The ICC incorporates each cell as a separate legal entity without the cell company needing to have any shareholder relationship with the relevant cell.</p>\n<p>There is also an interesting investment company regime for open-ended and closed-ended funds investing the pooled capital of investors in financial securities.</p>\n<p>Cryptocurrency exchanges also find a regulated environment to conduct their activities. They are regulated in a similar manner to &ldquo;Multilateral Trading Facilities&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>Exchanges that include cryptos that are considered securities will remain subject to the relevant regulatory requirements and will need to obtain another license as a Recognized Investment Exchange or Recognized Clearing House.</p>\n<p>In addition, the ADGM has recently introduced a new Tech Startup License, in which qualified startups will be able to access one of the most robust regulatory regimes for finance, flexibility in structuring options and a growing community of funds, banks, family offices, advisors and corporate partners.</p>\n<p>The new Tech Start-up License is highly flexible, start-ups can receive a full operational license, the option to apply for four residential visas and meet the requirement for a registered address with a virtual office lease, at a nominal cost of USD 700.</p>\n<p>ADGM is also an aviation powerhouse, including an ecosystem of aviation finance and aircraft leasing activities.</p>\n<p>AGDM companies also have access to a solid, capitalized and high-quality banking sector.</p>\n<p>Directors and employees, and their dependents are eligible for business visas. Usually, a company is authorized to apply for a visa per 100 sq. ft. of leased office space.</p>\n<p>Visas are valid for up to 3 years, renewable, and entitle its holder to reside in any of the 7 states of UAE.</p>',

				countryDetails:
					"<p>Antigua and Barbuda is a Central American country part of the Commonwealth. Formed by several islands to the east of the Caribbean Sea. The country is located on the Lesser Antilles and borders the island of Guadalupe to the south, Montserrat to the southwest, Saint Kitts and Nevis to the west and San Bartolome to the northwest. Saint John, located on the island of Antigua, is its capital, its most populated city, and its main port.&nbsp; Its official currency is the East Caribbean Dollar (XCD), which is pegged to the US$ at a 2.7:1 ratio.</p>\n<p>Antigua and Barbuda is a unitary, parliamentary, representative democratic monarchy, in which the Head of State is the Monarch who appoints the Governor General as vice-regal representative. Elizabeth II is the present Queen of Antigua and Barbuda, having served in that position since the islands' independence from the United Kingdom in 1981.</p>\n<p>Antigua and Barbuda is a beneficiary of the U.S. Caribbean Basin Initiative that grants duty-free entry into the United States for many goods. It is a member of the Caribbean Community and Common Market (CARICOM) and the CARICOM Single Market and Economy (CSME). Antigua is a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO),&nbsp; WIPO, UNCTAD, among other international institutions.</p>\n<p>Its main economic sector is tourism, which accounts for approximately 60 percent of the GDP and 40 percent of investments. The agricultural sector is domestic-oriented, mainly of sugar cane, cotton and fruits and considerably limited by its reduced water supply. Other important economic activities include oil refining, textile, carpentry, rum production, beer, cement, local crafts, and furniture.</p>\n<p>The country enjoys a high standard of living, well-educated workforce and high average life expectancy.</p>\n<p>Antigua is also an offshore financial center, with a legal and tax framework advantageous for the establishment of International Business Companies, which are fully tax exempt, provided that no business is done within the territory. Antigua also offers an Economic Citizenship Program, where it is possible to obtain a second passport through an investment.</p>",

This can be done by being hired as an employee for a&#xA0;Panama&#xA0;corporation or directly&#xA0;incorporating a company. While there is no requirement for this company to have any employees, it cannot be a dormant entity and must show some degree of activity. It is up to the authorities to determine if a company&#x2019;s activities are adequate, however,&#xA0;officials tend to be quite lenient on this.</p>\n<p>Next, you will have to prove that you are economically solvent by depositing USD 5,000 in a Panamanian bank account. If you have dependents who are also applying for the visa, you will have to deposit USD 2,000 per dependent. Dependents include the applicant&#x2019;s spouse, and children under 18 years of age, or 25 if they are full-time university students.<br>\nYou will receive a temporary residency card, which is valid for one year, while your application is under review. Once it is approved, you will get a permanent residency card, and will be allowed to apply for a work permit.</p>\n<p><strong>Costs</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Personal Bank Account: Personal bank account &#x2013; USD 750 (In-person); or Private Banking personal account &#x2013; USD 1,000; (USD 20,000 bank deposit) (Remotely)</li>\n<li>Panama Incorporation &#x2013; USD 2,550 + USD 700 for 3 Directors (All Panamanian corporations must have at least 3 directors)</li>\n<li>Corporate bank account (Optional) &#x2013; USD 2,000; if Private Banking personal account used, the USD 20,000 deposit can be split between Personal &amp; Corporate accounts.</li>\n<li>Permanent Residency &#x2013; USD 3,800</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Step 1</strong></p>\n<p>Open a personal bank account &#x2013; You have two options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Open a personal bank account &#x2013; Minimum deposit is USD 5,000 and you will have to travel to Panama to open. You should plan to be in Panama for 2-3 work days.</li>\n<li>Open Private Banking account &#x2013; Minimum deposit is USD 20,000. It can be done remotely.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>3-5 weeks to open a personal bank account (either option).</p>\n<p><strong>Step 2&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p>Incorporating a Panama&#xA0;company, which takes 2-5 days once all required documents are collected.</p>\n<p>If you want to open a corporate bank account, this can either be set up remotely (if Private Banking option is chosen) or upon your visit to start the Friendly Nations Visa Program.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 3</strong></p>\n<p>Once the bank account is opened, you can travel to&#xA0;Panama&#xA0;to fill out the initial&#xA0;Friendly&#xA0;Nations&#xA0;Visa&#xA0;(Permanent Residency) application forms and file the required documents. You will get a Temporary Residency Permit. This step will take at least 8 business days.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 4</strong></p>\n<p>After 3-4 months, you will need to travel to&#xA0;Panama&#xA0;(if you are not there) to receive the Permanent Residency status. This step usually takes 2-3 days.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 5&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p>After other 3-4 months. You will need to travel to&#xA0;Panama&#xA0;(if you are not there) to receive your&#xA0;Panama&#xA0;Cedula&#xA0; (ID Card) and conclude the process.</p>\n<p>The whole permanent residency process takes approximately 10-12 months. However, you can freely travel in and out of&#xA0;Panama&#xA0;and establish there, after receiving temporary residency (Step 3).</p>\n<span class="cp-load-after-post"></span> ',

				introduction:
					'<p>Panama is an international trade and financial center strategically located between the Americas. Its politically stable environment, its pro-business legislation, its attractive tax regime, and a developed and large banking sector have made Panama one of the most popular jurisdiction to establish international companies.</p>\n<p>Panama has excellent infrastructure and communications and is one of the largest international distribution and free trade centers worldwide.</p>\n<p>A <em>Sociedad de Responsabilidad Limitada</em> (SRL) is a hybrid of a corporation and a partnership, similar to UK LLPs. SRLs may be considered tax neutral entities and profits may be taxed at the personal level.</p>\n<p>Non-resident members may pay personal income taxes in their country of residence on the SRL profits proportionally to their share of participation in the SRL, whether distributed or not.</p>\n<p>It is important to note that certain countries do not recognize the pass-through status of an SRL, if the SRL is deemed to be tax resident in one of such countries, it may be subject to local corporate income tax.</p>\n<p>SRL&rsquo;s tax transparency may allow residents of certain jurisdiction to not be penalized under controlled foreign company rules.</p>\n<p>In addition, Panama levies taxation in a territorial basis, hence SRLs in Panama that exclusively conducts its business outside of Panama, are exempt from all local taxes including income tax, capital gains tax and withholding taxes. Furthermore, interest paid by local banks are tax-exempt and there are no foreign exchange controls.</p>\n<p>Unlike a corporation, an SRL requires at least two members, and its details are disclosed in a public registry. At least one manager is required who may be a member or a third party. There are no initial capital requirements.</p>\n<p>Panama SRLs exclusively doing business outside the country, also benefit from minimal reporting requirements as they are not required to file annual return nor tax return, neither filing any kind of statements or financial reports.</p>\n<p>The incorporation process is quick and straightforward, and the ongoing maintenance costs are low.</p>\n<p>In addition, citizens of more than 50 countries (denominated friendly nations), may be eligible to apply for a permanent residence permit through incorporation, provided that certain conditions are met.</p>\n<p>Panama is a compliant jurisdiction and has agreed to implement the OECD&rsquo;s automatic exchange of information for tax purposes (AEoI) by 2018.</p>\n<p>Panama SRLs are commonly used for fund management, e-commerce, access to banking and merchant accounts, and professional services.</p>',

During his lifetime, the founder can retain the right to remove and appoint directors (but in this case the founder cannot be a beneficiary).</p>\n<p>The board of trustees consists of at least three members, two of whom must have their permanent residence in the EU or EEA.</p>\n<p>Beneficiaries, their spouses or partners, next of kin of beneficiaries and relatives as distant as third cousins, as well as legal persons, are excluded from serving on the board of trustees.</p>\n<p><strong>Supervisory board</strong> - The supervisory board is mandatory only for Private Foundations of a size defined by law (if the number of employees of a Private Foundation or of a corporation(s) managed by a Private Foundation exceeds 300).</p>\n<p>The declaration of establishment may nevertheless also appoint bodies with supervisory or advisory responsibilities for any type of Private Foundations.</p>\n<p><strong>Beneficiaries</strong> &ndash; The beneficiaries may be determined in the addendum to the deed. This addendum is not filed with the court. Therefore, the names and identities of the beneficiaries are not accessible to the public and a third party inspecting the Austrian Register of Companies will usually only learn that a person has formed a private foundation and has paid up the minimum amount.</p>\n<p>Beneficiaries&rsquo; right to information - A beneficiary is entitled to request and receive information from the Private Foundation on the execution of its purpose and may also inspect its annual financial statements, books, the deed of establishment, etc. A beneficiary may bring suit against the Private Foundation only if the declaration states this is possible.</p>\n<p><strong>Declaration of Establishment</strong> &ndash; The declaration of establishment documents the legal intent of the founder to dedicate assets to a defined purpose.</p>\n<p>The declaration of establishment must include, in particular, details of the contribution of assets, the purpose of the Private Foundation, beneficiaries, the name and domicile of the Private Foundation, duration.</p>\n<p>The declaration of establishment may also contain, rules governing the board of trustees, rules governing the auditor of the Private Foundation and other executive bodies, conditions concerning the revocation of the declaration of establishment, designation of a final beneficiary in the event of the dissolution of the Private Foundation, supplementary contributions.</p>\n<p>Certain elements can be made private by using a supplementary form. The entry in the register of firms of such a supplementary declaration of establishment is not required, as no reasonable public interest exists which would justify such a far-reaching disclosure of the details of a Private Foundation.</p>\n<p><strong>Re-domiciliation</strong> &ndash; Not permitted.</p>\n<p><strong>Mergers</strong> - There is no ability for an Austrian foundation to merge with any other entity.</p>\n<p><strong>Charitable/Philanthropic Purposes</strong> - Permitted.</p>\n<p><strong>Compliance</strong> &ndash;&nbsp; The law mandates additional control mechanisms for all Private Foundations, for example, the auditing of a Private Foundation&rsquo;s books by a certified public accountant or auditor. Any member of an executive body of a Private Foundation may request the courts to order a special audit to ensure that the purpose of the Private Foundation is being fulfilled.</p>',

				introduction:
					'<p>The Cook Islands was one of the first jurisdictions to enact explicit asset protection and international trusts law, being one of the most popular for such matters.</p>\n<p>Trust laws in the Cook Islands limit fraudulent transfer claims for 2 years and in some circumstances, it may be less than one year.</p>\n<p>If the assets are transferred in a period in which the settlor is solvent, the transfer of funds cannot be set aside.</p>\n<p>The legal provisions in force also establish certain conditions for a person to be able to be considered as the creditor and able to file a lawsuit before a court in the Cook Islands.</p>\n<p>These provisions raise the burden of proof beyond reasonable doubt, for such reason, confidentiality laws prohibit the disclosure of banking information, except if there is the consent of the client.</p>\n<p>The Government of the Cook Islands requires compliance with certain provisions that must be met in order to ensure the honesty and integrity of the funds transferred to the rust. Therefore, the assets that make up the trust cannot come from the exercise of illegal and fraudulent activities such as drug trafficking and money laundering.</p>\n<p>Foreign judgments are not enforceable. If any person wants to file suit against the trust, he must hire an attorney in the Cook Islands to initiate the action, which is subject to strict compliance with requirements for him to proceed.</p>\n<p>The settlor can maintain control over the trust and its property if it so provides.</p>\n<p>Foreign bankruptcy rules are excluded.</p>\n<p>The law specifies that fraudulent transfers are understood to require compliance with requirements to be assessed by a court.</p>\n<p>The trust cannot be affected by the rules regarding heirs or spendthrift beneficiaries in the settlor&rsquo;s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>Trusts may hold shares in underlying companies, without concern about the financial benefits of retaining such shares. Likewise, in relation to the foregoing, the ability of the settlor to supervise and intervene in the affairs of an underlying company may be limited.</p>',

				countryDetails:
					'<p>The Cook Islands is an archipelago of fifteen small islands, located in the South Pacific Ocean, between Hawaii and New Zealand. It is a member of the Commonwealth and it is freely associated with New Zealand. Cook Islands citizens are also New Zealand citizens.</p>\n<p>The islands have a combined area of 236 sq. km, but the Exclusive Economic Zone occupies more than 1,800,000 square kilometers of ocean.</p>\n<p>It is populated by about 21,000 inhabitants. Most of them living in Rarotonga Island, where is found its capital Avarua and its international airport.</p>\n<p>Its official languages are the Cook Islands Māori and English. Its official currency is the Cook Islands dollar and the New Zealand dollar, the first pegged to the second.</p>\n<p>The Cook Islands is a dependency with a representative parliamentary democracy, where the Chief Minister is the Head of State. The islands are self-governing in free association with New Zealand and are fully responsible for internal affairs. New Zealand retains some external affairs responsibilities, in consultation with the Cook Islands.</p>\n<p>Its economy, like other South Pacific islands economies, is hampered by its isolation, lack of exploitable natural resources, a natural disaster-prone location, and poor infrastructure. Tourism is the main source of income and, to a lesser extent, the cultivation of tropical fruits and their processing, manufacture of clothing and handicrafts.</p>\n<p>In addition to tourism, the other main economic sector is the offshore industry. The Cook Islands has attractive legislation that makes it possible to set up tax-free international companies, offshore banks, insurance companies, and asset protection trusts.</p',
				legalParagraph:
					'<p><strong>Country code</strong> &ndash; CK</p>\n<p><strong>Legal basis</strong> &ndash; Common law</p>\n<p><strong>Legal framework</strong> &ndash; Cook Islands International Trust Act 1984 (Amended 1989)</p>\n<p><strong>Formal name</strong> &ndash; International Trust</p>\n<p><strong>Settlor</strong> &ndash; The settlor is the person who establishes and whose assets are put into the trust. The settlor of an International Trust in the Cook Islands may also be the beneficiary of those assets and may retain control of the trust. An international trust is not invalidated because of the subsequent bankruptcy of the settlor.</p>\n<p><strong>Trustee</strong> &ndash; Trustees are natural or legal persons who hold the title to the assets and manage the trust, but they cannot benefit from it. A sole or multiple trustees may be appointed. A custodian trustee is permitted, provided that the trust holds, but does not manage a property. Management of the property will be the responsibility of a managing trustee.</p>\n<p><strong>Trustee Liability</strong> &ndash; A trust deed&rsquo;s provision may limit the liability of a trustee, or provide relief or indemnity.</p>\n<p><strong>Beneficiaries</strong> &ndash; Beneficiaries are those who get benefit from the trust. There are specific provisions to prevent beneficiaries from draining the trust of its assets and spending in a thrifty way. International Trusts allows avoiding both probate and forced heirship rules.</p>\n<p><strong>Protector</strong> &ndash; Optional figure appointed by the settlor who oversees trust&rsquo;s operation and has the power to appoint trustees, and vetoes any actions that the trustee might make on behalf of the settlor.</p>\n<p><strong>Trust deed</strong> &ndash; The private document on which the trust is drafted is not needed to be filed with the Registrar.</p>\n<p><strong>Disclosure</strong> - Assets in the trusts are not disclosed to Cook Islands authorities and the law makes it a crime to identify who owns the trusts or to provide any information about them.</p>\n<p><strong>Protection from foreign judgments</strong> &ndash; The International Trust act provides specific provisions to ignore and not enforce judgments. The Hague Convention on Trusts does not apply in the Cook Islands.</p>\n<p><strong>Protection from creditors</strong> &ndash; The International Trust Act repeals the Statute of Elizabeth, so transfers by the settlor to the trust may not be set aside if the settlor transferred the property before the debt arose. The creditor must prove the fraudulent transfer of assets to the trust, which is clearly defined by the law. Creditor claims are separated and cannot be brought jointly. The Cook Islands has a one-year statute of limitations on fraudulent transfer. If a fraudulent transfer is proven, the trust may not be declared invalid.</p>\n<p><strong>Protection for immigrant trusts</strong> &ndash; Trusts that migrate from other jurisdictions may benefit from retroactive protection.</p>\n<p><strong>Community property</strong> &ndash; Community properties transferred to a Cook Islands&rsquo; international trust may retain its community property character. It is also possible to preserve the separate property status of assets held before marriage in a community property state.</p>\n<p><strong>Exclusion of foreign law</strong> - An international trust or disposition of property held by the trust will not be void, voidable, liable to be set aside or defective by reason that the laws of any foreign jurisdiction prohibit or do not recognize the concept of a trust, or that the laws of the Cook Islands are inconsistent with any foreign law.</p>\n<p><strong>Choice of law</strong> &ndash; The choice of law of the Cook Islands or any other law, to govern the trust or a particular aspect of that trust, is valid, effective and conclusive regardless of any other circumstances.</p>\n<p><strong>Compliance</strong> &ndash;&nbsp; International trusts are subject to a registration fee and an annual renewal fee.</p>',
				taxesParagraph:
					'<p>A trust established in the Cook Islands may not be subject to local taxes applicable to the assets and income of the trust, provided that no residents of the Cook Islands benefit from the trust and no physical assets are located there.</p>\n<p>It must be noted that the choice of law of the trust would not be applicable to tax matters, which would be governed by the respective jurisdiction where the settlor, beneficiaries, assets or trustee are located, as applicable.</p>\n<p>You should consult with your tax advisor or accountant to know the tax implications in your jurisdiction of residence when establishing a trust in the Cook Islands , transfer assets to it and receive profits from said assets.</p>',
