                        p
                            | You accept and acknowledge that there are risks associated with utilising the SelfKey Wallet including, but not limited to:

                        p
                            | 3.1	The risk of failure of hardware, software and Internet connections, the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorised access to information stored within your SelfKey Wallet, including, but not limited to your SelfKey Wallet address and private key. You accept and acknowledge that SelfKey will not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you may experience when using the SelfKey Wallet, howsoever caused.
                        p
                            | 3.2	The inherent risks associated with cryptographic systems. You acknowledge that you have an understanding of the usage and intricacies of native cryptographic tokens smart contract based tokens, and blockchain-based software systems generally.
                        p
                            | 3.3	The risk that the SelfKey Wallet could be impacted by one or more regulatory inquiries or regulatory actions, which could impede or limit your ability to access or use the SelfKey Wallet.

                            | 3.5	The risks inherent in the fact that cryptography is constantly evolving and current systems cannot guarantee absolute security going forward.

                            | 3.6	The risk that virtual currency may be lost or stolen.

You acknowledge that you are responsible for safeguarding the private key to your SelfKey Wallet. SelfKey will not be liable for any losses due to any situation in which a private key is lost, divulged, destroyed or otherwise compromised.
